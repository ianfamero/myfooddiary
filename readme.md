# My Food Diary

A simple web application that can be used to track your daily calorie intake.

## Description

My Food Diary is a personal project I did in the past to aid my own weight-loss journey. Tracking a personâ€™s daily calorie intake is a proven way for a successful weight loss program. In order to lose weight, a person has to create a calorie deficit. By keeping a food diary, a person trying to lose weight will be able to stay within their allowed daily calorie limit.
